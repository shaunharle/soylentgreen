## The Concept:
I will make a web app which will, after making 2 or 3 selections, allow you to paste a recipe into an input field which will then use a database of terms to replace parts of it make the recipe vegan. People don't realize that they can take nearly any recipe and make it vegan, so it'll be primarily to illustrate that point. The reason for the questions before being able to enter the recipe is because you'll use different styles of replacements if it's baking vs cooking.

## MVP
The ability to paste in a recipe and get back a converted recipe that isn't total gibberish

## Stretch goals
I'm not sure. Have another tab for cute animal gifs from giphy? It's a relatively simple concept but I think trying to find different curveball terms to switch out with vegetable based products will be tedious so my MVP may be pretty difficult.


## Tech I'm planning to use:
- Styled components
- Ruby on Rails backend
- React front end (though may switch to ejs as a last resort)



## Expected blockers
- I think that just switching out a couple of terms may result in some recipes that seem like broken English and be slightly less readable
- Some recipes just won't outright convert, i.e. you can't make an omelette with applesauce instead of eggs, so that conversion won't work properly.
