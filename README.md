## The Concept:
Display recipes and have the ability to search if you know the name of the recipe you're looking for.

## MVP
Display recipes and have a search function.


## Tech used:
- Ruby on Rails backend
- React front end
- Webpacker to really tie things together in an overly complicated manner.
- Bootstrap
- Heroku

## Current thoughts
I think it's really neat that I was able to build this and make it run on only one server, but I would not have intentionally chosen that method of accomplishing this task if I knew what it was going to be like.



## Later plans
I'd very much like to go back into this and adjust the create route so I can have custom pictures so it's not the same picture for everything, aside from having to manually seed the database, which kind of defeats the purpose of having the create route. I'd also like to mess with the search function and do a bunch of styling.
